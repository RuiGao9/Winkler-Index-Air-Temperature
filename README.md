## Required inputs (demo data) for this repository
- `Demo_Data.csv` is the example one-year data record. It can be easily obtained from an eddy-covariance flux tower or other air temperature sensors. The unit of this Winkler Index is (℃∙day, base 10 ℃). The `CSV` should at least contain 6 variables:
    - Year
    - Month
    - Day
    - Hour
    - Minute
    - Ta<br>

## Brief introduction of this repository
This repository computes the **Winkler Index** directly from **hourly air temperature data** collected by an **eddy-covariance flux tower**. It also provides an optional visualization module to plot **daily maximum, minimum, and mean air temperature** time series.
